# Deployment Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve deployment issues with Vercel and Edge Runtime.

## Issues Fixed

1. **JWT Export Function Issues**
   - Added missing `verifyJWT` and `verifyAuth` functions to `src/utils/jwt.ts`
   - Created a script `fix-jwt-exports.js` to fix import paths in route files
   - These function aliases ensure consistent imports across the codebase

2. **Edge Runtime Compatibility Issues**
   - Updated `fix-runtime.js` to ensure all API routes explicitly use Node.js runtime 
   - Created safe imports for Sequelize models with dynamic imports
   - Updated JWT utilities to handle Edge Runtime safely

3. **Node.js Version Compatibility**
   - Updated `check-node-version.js` to be less strict during development
   - Installed compatible version of `glob` (version 9.3.5) that works with Node.js 18.x
   - This resolves the warnings about unsupported engine versions

4. **Build Process Improvements**
   - Added `fix-jwt-exports.js` to the prebuild and vercel-build scripts
   - Updated README with troubleshooting information

## Build Scripts

The project now includes several helper scripts to ensure smooth deployment:

- **check-node-version.js**: Ensures Node.js version compatibility
- **check-edge-imports.js**: Checks for problematic imports in Edge Runtime files
- **fix-runtime.js**: Adds Node.js runtime directives to all API routes
- **fix-jwt-exports.js**: Fixes JWT utility imports in route files
- **fix-babel.js**: Fixes Babel dependencies
- **fix-fonts.js**: Fixes font import issues

## How to Use

Run the following prebuild script before deployment:

```bash
npm run prebuild
```

This will automatically run all necessary fixes to prepare for deployment.

## Known Issues

- Some warnings about unsupported engine versions might still appear during installation
- These warnings can be safely ignored as the fixes ensure compatibility at runtime

## Future Improvements

- Consider upgrading to Node.js 20.x when all dependencies are compatible
- Enhance the fix scripts to handle more edge cases automatically
- Add more validation to ensure routes are properly configured
